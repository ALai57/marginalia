==========
*lightweight literate programming for clojure inspired by [docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/)*


To get a quick look at what marginalia output looks like:

1. `git clone https://github.com/fogus/marginalia.git`
2. `open ./marginalia/example-output/uberdoc.html` (or [look here](http://fogus.me/fun/marginalia/))
